# Lliw 
*Roughly pronounced hlew*, it is "colour" in Welsh

Lliw provides colours for your terminal, with no additional dependencies.

# Aims

- No dependencies
- Works in `#![no_std]` environments
- Provides colours and styles in a non-opinionated way
- Provides multiple ways to use
- Doesn't make your code look like trash
- Doesn't assume how you'll use the crate

# Installation

If you have `cargo-edit` installed, it's as easy as:

```sh
cargo add lliw
```

if you don't have `cargo-edit` you can add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
[dependencies]
lliw = "0"
```

# Example usage

```rust
use lliw::{Fg, Bg, Style, Reset};

fn main() {
    // Prints "Blue" in a blue colour
    println!("{}Blue{}", Fg::Blue, Fg::Reset);
    // Prints "Bold" in bold
    println!("{}Bold{}", Style::Bold, Style::NoBold);
    // Prints "Green" with a green background
    println!("{}Green{}", Bg::Green, Bg::Reset);
    
    // You can even use it in more complicated ways
    println!(
        "{}{}Attention!{}{} You have {}{}1{}{} new message",
        Style::Underline, Fg::Yellow,
        Style::NoUnderline, Fg::Reset,
        Bg::White, Fg::Black,
        Bg::Reset, Fg::Reset,
    );
    
    // You can make them go over the top of each other too
    println!(
        "{}Hello{} Wor{}ld! My{} Name{} {}Is{} Lliw{}",
        Style::Italic, Fg::LightPurple, 
        Bg::Black, Fg::Reset, Style::NoItalic, 
        Style::Underline, Bg::Reset, Reset
    );

    // Don't like these long formatting macros? You can use it like this too!
    print!("{}", Fg::LightRed);
    print!("Hello\nThere!");
    print!("{}\n", Reset);

    // You can also use an RGB value if you want 24-bit colours
    println!(
        "{}R{}a{}i{}n{}b{}o{}w{}",
        Fg::Rgb(255, 0, 0),
        Fg::Rgb(255, 128, 0),
        Fg::Rgb(255, 255, 0),
        Fg::Rgb(0, 255, 0),
        Fg::Rgb(0, 255, 255),
        Fg::Rgb(128, 0, 255),
        Fg::Rgb(255, 0, 128),
        Fg::Reset,
    );
}
```

# Usage

There are 3 enums provided with lliw, `Fg`, `Bg` and `Style`.
There is also 1 struct, `Reset`.

- `Fg` - Control the text colour
	+ Consists of the types: Rgb, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Purple, Cyan, White,
    LightBlack, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow,
    LightBlue, LightPurple, LightCyan, LightWhite and Reset.
    + The colours are reset using the `Reset` variant.
    + You can use the Rgb variant to provide true 24-bit colour values
- `Bg` - Control the text background colour
	+ Consists of the types: Rgb, Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Purple, Cyan, White,
    LightBlack, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow,
    LightBlue, LightPurple, LightCyan, LightWhite and Reset.
    + The colours are reset using the `Reset` variant.
    + You can use the Rgb variant to provide true 24-bit colour values
- `Style` - Control the text styles
	+ Consists of the types: Bold, NoBold, Underline, NoUnderline, Strike, NoStrike, Italic, NoItalic, Inverse, NoInverse, Faint and NoFaint.
		+ Bold: Make the text bold, can be terminated with `NoBold`
		+ Underline: Make the text have an underline, can be terminated with `NoUnderline`
		+ Italic: Make the text go italic, can be terminated with `NoItalic`
		+ Inverse: Inverse the text colours, can be terminated with `NoInverse`
		+ Faint: Make the text fainter, can be terminated with `NoFaint`
		+ Strike: Make the text have a strike through it, can be terminated with `NoStrike`
- `Reset` - This is a full reset struct that resets foreground, background and style when used.
